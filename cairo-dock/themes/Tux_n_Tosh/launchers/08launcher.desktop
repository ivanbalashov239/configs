#b Prevent this launcher from stealing appli from taskbar ?
#{Use this option for exemple if the launcher launches a script in a terminal but you don't want it to steal normal terminal's icons from the TaskBar, or if you explicitely want to use the original icon of the TaskBar because it provides some info, for exemple Pidgin's icons represent the avatar of the contact.}

#{The only reason you may want to modify this parameter is if you made this launcher by hands. If you dropped it into the dock from the menu, it is nearly sure that you shouldn't touch it. It defines the class of the program, which is useful to link the appli with its launcher.}
